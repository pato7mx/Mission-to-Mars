# Mission to Mars Project

In this project we created a Web application that gathers data from differet web sites abot the Mission to Mars.

The data was scraped from NASA News website and Astronomy Web site, and includes the latest news, relevant facts and featured images of Mars and its moons.

For this we employed a python sript that uses Splinter, Beautiful Soup to scrap data from websites, then uses PyMongo to sotred collected data in a Mongo DB, and finally crates a web browser with Flask in HTML
