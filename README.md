# Mission to Mars Project

In this project we created a Web application that gathers data from different websites abot the Mission to Mars.

The data was scraped from NASA News website and Astrogeology website, and includes: the latest news, relevant facts and featured images of Mars and its moons hemispheres.

For this, we employed a Python script that uses Splinter and Beautiful Soup to automate scraping data from websites, then uses PyMongo to store collected data into a NoSQL Mongo database and, finally, crates a web browser with Flask in HTML language. To improve the lookness of this website CSS and Bootstrap was employed.
