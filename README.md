# Mission to Mars Project

In this project we created a Web application that gathers data from differet web sites abot the Mission to Mars.

The data was scraped from NASA News website and Astronomy Web site, and includes the latest news, relevant facts and featured images of Mars and its moons.

For this, we employed a Python sript that uses Splinter and Beautiful Soup to automate scrap data from websites, then uses PyMongo to store collected data in a NoSQL Mongo database, and, finally crates a web browser with Flask in HTML language. To improve the lookness of this website CSS and Bootstrap was employed.
